ADMIXTOOLS version 5.1  9/18/18 (for Linux and Mac)

See README.INSTALL for installation info. 

The ADMIXTOOLS package implements 5 methods described in 
Patterson et al. (2012) Ancient Admixture in Human History. Details of the methods and algorithm can be found in this paper.

The package contains 6 programs: 
convertf: See README.CONVERTF for documentation of programs for converting file formats.
qp3Pop: See README.3PopTest for details of running f_3 test. This test can be used as a format test of admixture with 3 populations.
qpBound: See README.3PopTest for details of running qpBound. This test can be used for estimating bounds on the admixture proportions, given 3 populations (2 reference and one target).
qpDstat: See README.Dstatistics for details of running D-statistics. This is a formal test of admixture with 4 populations.
qpF4Ratio: See README.F4RatioTest for details of running F4 ratio estimation. This program computes the admixture proportion by taking the ratio of two f4 tests.
rolloff:  See README.ROLLOFF/ README.ROLLOFF_OUTPUT for details for running rolloff. This program can be used for dating admixture events.
 
Executables and source code:
----------------------------
All C executables are in the bin/ directory.

We have placed source code for all C executables in the src/ directory, 
for users who wish to modify and recompile our programs.  For example, to
recompile the programs, type
"cd src"
"make clobber"
"make install"      

If you are building on a Mac, you will need gsl and openblas installed. 
"brew install gsl"
"brew install homebrew/science/openblas"
Uncomment the lines in src/Makefile that modify the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. 

If you have trouble compiling and running our code, try compiling and
running the examples in the examples/ directory. Download the example
datasets from https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/AdmixTools_Example_Data.tar_.gz
and untar in the root AdmixTools directory, creating a subdirectory called ./data. 

"cd examples"
"./mklog"

If you are unable to run the examples successfully, please contact
your system administrator for help, as this is probably systems issue which is
beyond our scope.

DOCUMENTATION OF D-statistics (qpDstat):

The 4-population test, implemented here as D-statistics, is also a formal test for admixture based on a four taxon 4 statistic, which can provide some information about the direction of gene ﬂow.
For any 4 populations (W, X, Y, Z), qpDstat computes the D-statistics as - 
num = (w − x)(y − z )
den = (w + x − 2wx)(y + z − 2yz )

D = num/ den

The output of qpDstat is informative about the direction of gene flow. So for 4 populations (W, X, Y, Z) as follows - 
If the Z-score is +ve, then the gene flow occured either between W and Y or X and Z 
If the Z-score is -ve, then the gene flow occured either between W and Z or X and Y. 

qpDstat requires that the input data is available in a Reichlab format such as EIGENSTRAT.  
To convert to the appropriate format, one can use CONVERTF. See 
README.CONVERTF for documentation of programs for converting file formats.

Executable and source code:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The executables of AdmixTools are available here:
https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/releases
 
Please aware AdmixTools is designed for Linux system. If the executables don't work on your Linux machine, please compile and install the program. For information about installing the program, see README.ADMIXTOOLS. After installing the programs, the executable for D-statistics (qpDstat) should be located in the bin directory.

To run qpDstat, type the following on a linux machine. 
$DIR/bin/qpDstat -p parfile [-l lo] [-h hi] >logfile

$DIR: Path to the bin directory.
logfile: Name of the logfile. The logfile contains the output of the run. 
parfile: Name of parameter file

NEW FEATURE
In some cases using popfilename (see below) the program uses an excessive amount of memory.  
A solution, designed to be convenient is to make multiple runs with -l lo -h hi set when only lines 
lo through hi (starting at 1) of popfilename will be used.  This makes it easy to do multiple runs 
and then extract all results by grep result: ... 

DESCRIPTION OF EACH PARAMETER in parfile:

genotypename:   input genotype file (in eigenstrat format)
snpname:   input snp file      (in eigenstrat format)
indivname:   input indiv file    (in eigenstrat format)
poplistname:  list_qpDstat (contains list of poulations- one population on each line). Program will run the method for all quadrapules.
popfilename:   list_qpDstat1 (Enter a list of tests you want to perform - 4 populations on each line. <pop1> <pop2> <pop3> <pop4>). Program will run the method for each quadrapule (included on each line). 
## optional parameter  
f4mode:   YES      
## default NO 
## f4 statistics not D-stats are computed

DESCRIPTION OF OUTPUT FILE:
The program will write all the output to stdout. The output file prints the parfile entered by the user, number of snps and individuals, jackknife block size, number of blocks for jackknife and the results.

The results have the following format -
result:   Pop1 (W)  Pop2 (X) : Pop3 (Y)  Pop4 (Z)  D-stat	Z	BABA	ABBA	#_of_SNPs_that_all_populations_have_data	

The result for each quadrppule is shown on a separate line.

See example shown in-
examples/qpDstat.log, examples/qpDstat1.log

NOTE:
Z = D/standard_error
If you would like qpDstat to output standard error, please add this following line to your parameter file:
printsd:  YES

==========================================================================
New program:  qpDpart;  implements partitioned D-stats 
(Eaton and Ree.   Inferring phylogeny and introgression .. Systematic Biology (2013) (Vol 62:5) pp 689-706)
parameter file as qpDstat with the following exceptions. 
pattern:  pat1 : pat2   
## pat1, pat2 are AB patterns of same length (L) 
popfilename:  myfile 
##myfile will consisit of L populatons / line.  
fmode:  YES 
## prints abba(pat1) - abba(pat2) NOT D-stat ;  Note fmode NOT f4mode
fscale:   10000000  
## if fmode: YES  f-stats are multiplied by fscale on printing.  Default is 1000000 
## This is because if L is large f may be quite small.  
## pattern:  BABA : ABBA  will pprduce results very similar to qpDstat

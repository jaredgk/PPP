>Potential GREP commands to create an output file with only the Chromosome name:


For the Individual Names:
1. Find the header row:
grep "CHROM" inputFile

2. Turn the columns into rows:
tr -s '[:blank:] '\n' < inputFile > outputFile

3. Only have the Chromosome names within the file:
grep -A500 'FORMAT' outputFile | grep -v "FORMAT"

500 is arbitrary values. so if sample size is greater than 500, it would not work.

sed -n -e '/CHROM/$p' filename > output

cat justdata.vcf awk '{print $1}' > chroms
cat chroms | sort | uniq
